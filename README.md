### Interview README

We're interested in seeing how you write React code, not how you set up a basic React project. To ensure that we have plenty of time to see your coding skills during the interview, follow these instructions to get your environment setup. You should join the interview with the app running.

1. **Clone this repository**: This will be the base of your project.
2. **Get your environment ready**: Run `nvm install && nvm use` to install and use the latest NodeJS version
3. **Install necessary dependencies**: You can do this by running `npm i` or using your desired package manager.
4. **Confirm that the app starts up**: Run the command `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:5173. You should see our logo and a nice message.
5. **Turn off AI-powered code generators**: As much as we love new technology, we'd like to see your code! Please turn off any AI-powered code generators such as Copilot.

This is it! You're all set for the interview. Best of luck!
